# Cybersecurity Internship - Task 1

## Task 1 â€“ Network Scanning and Analysis

### Description
This task focuses on performing basic network scanning and analyzing open ports to understand network security.

### Steps Completed

1. **Install Nmap**  
   Installed Nmap from the official website to perform network scanning.

2. **Find Local IP Range**  
   Determined the local network IP range (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`).

3. **Run TCP SYN Scan**  
   Performed a TCP SYN scan using Nmap to detect active devices and open ports.

4. **Document Open Ports**  
   Recorded the IP addresses and open ports found during the scan.

5. **Optional Packet Analysis**  
   Analyzed captured network packets using Wireshark for deeper inspection.

6. **Service Research**  
   Researched common services running on the detected open ports.

7. **Security Assessment**  
   Identified potential security risks associated with the open ports.

8. **Save Results**  
   Exported and saved scan results in text and HTML formats for documentation.

### Files Uploaded
- Screenshots of the scans  
- PDF report of the analysis
